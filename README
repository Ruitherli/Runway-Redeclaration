2. Installation Instructions

Step 1:
Install IntelliJ: If you don't already have IntelliJ installed, you can download it from the official website at https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/. Follow the instructions provided on the website to install IntelliJ on your computer.

Step 2:
Install XAMPP: Download and install XAMPP on your computer by following the instructions on the official website at https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html. Be sure to download the appropriate version of XAMPP for your operating system.

Step 3:
Set up the database: After installing XAMPP, open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services. Then, open your web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin. From here, you can create a new database and tables, and import any necessary data.

Step 4:
Configure the project: In IntelliJ, open the project and go to File -> Project Structure. Under "Project Settings", click on "Libraries" and then click the "+" button to add a new library. Choose "Java" as the library type and add the JDBC driver to the library. You can download the JDBC driver from the MySQL website at https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/. Once the library is added, go to File -> Settings and then navigate to "Build, Execution, Deployment" -> "Database". Here, you can add a new data source for your MySQL database and configure the connection URL, username, and password.

Step 5:
Test the connection: To test the connection between the project and the database, open the project and run the application. If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to connect to the database and perform database operations within your code.
